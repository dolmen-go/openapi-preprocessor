# openapi-preprocessor

`openapi-preprocessor` is an processing tool that gives flexibility to API documentation authors for writing OpenAPI 2.0/3.x specifications.

## Uses Cases

- Author your OpenAPI spec in YAML but publish as JSON.
- Split your OpenAPI spec source in multiple files for authoring, but publish a single file.
- Build multiple specs from shared parts.
- Merge spec generated from source code with your additional content created by hand.
- Use advanced inlining (`$inline`, `$merge`) to remove duplication (source of inconsistencies).
- Use advanced inlining (`$inline`, `$merge`) to produce complex schemas that share subset of properties.
- Derivate a spec to build a new spec with altered servers settings for localhost/staging/preprod environments.
- *Submit yours...*

## Features

- Every valid OpenAPI 2.0/3.x specification is a valid input (so you can easily start refactoring gradually from an existing spec)
- Allows to build a spec from multiple files; produces a single output file
- YAML or JSON input
- Produces an OpenAPI with maximum compatibility with consumming tools:
  - simplifies complex parts of the spec not supported by all tools
  - JSON output
- Adds a few keywords (`$inline`, `$merge`) that allow to avoid duplication of content and ease the writing of consistent documentation
- Removes unused global schemas (under `/components/schemas`), parameters (under `/components/parameters`) and responses (under `/components/responses`). This reduces risk of leaking work in progress or internal details.

## Install

### Install from source

A [Go 1.23+ development environment](https://go.dev/doc/install#install) is required.

Build `openapi-preprocessor` binary and install in `$GOPATH/bin`:

    $ make install

## Usage

    openapi-preprocessor [<option>...] <file>

## Keywords

### `$ref`

    { "$ref": "<file>" }
    { "$ref": "<file>#<pointer>" }
    { "$ref": "#<pointer>" }

`$ref` is like in OpenAPI, but it can reference content in external files using relative URLs as well as intra-document. The referenced part of the pointed document is injected into the output document.

Restrictions:
- JSON pointer location in the output document will be the same location as in the ref link. Example: `{"$ref": "external.yml#/components/parameters/Id"}` will import the content to `/components/parameters/Id`. This implies that partial files should have the same layout as a full spec (this is a feature as it enforces readability of partials).
- other properties along `$ref` are not allowed as the semantics in JSON Schema and Swagger/OpenAPI has evolved and the support in consuming tools may vary. Use `$merge` instead that has a strict behaviour in this tool.

### `$inline`

    { "$inline": "<file>#<pointer>"}

    {
        "$inline": "<file>#<pointer>",
        "pointer1": <value>, // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/pointer1
        "pointer2/slash": <value> // Overrides value deeply at <file>#<pointer>/pointer/slash
    }

`$inline` is an OpenAPI extension allowing to inject a copy of another part of a document in place. Keys along the `$inline` keyword are JSON pointers (with the leading `/` removed) allowing to override some parts of the inlined content.

If the target of `$inline` is a `$ref` and `$inline` has overrides, the link is dereferenced recursively before inlining.

Note: deep inlining (inlining a node which itself use `$inline` in its tree) might work, but will probably not (see [issue #6](https://github.com/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor/issues/6) as an example). Use instead `$merge` which supports it.

### `$merge`

    {
        "$merge": "<file>#<pointer>",
        "key": <value>,
        "key/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/key~1slash
    }

    {
        "$merge": [
            "<file1>#<pointer1>",
            "<file2>#<pointer2>" // Overrides keys from <file1>#<pointer1>
        ]
        "key": <value>,
        "key/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file2>#<pointer2>/key~1slash
    }


`$merge` is an OpenAPI extension allowing to copy a node, overriding some keys. This is a kind of inlined *`$ref` with keys overrides*.

## Examples

See the [testsuite](https://github.com/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor/tree/master/testdata).

Running a basic example:

    $ make
    $ ./openapi-preprocessor testdata/10-ref-ext/input.yml
